Our position for all public facing material, FOI�s PQ�s is below and we have sought advice that this is consistent and defensible;
� The Programme Name and Aims are in the public domain and not exempt
� Costs below single headline figure will be exempt under national security grounds
� Individual Project descriptions below headline programme aims will be exempt under national security grounds�
Previously CCD has been exempt from GMPP publications and FOI requests due to national security considerations, this aligns with the approach that has been taken on releasing any more detailed information under the FOI process with National Security Liaison Group  being particularly resistant  for any further breakdown on programme costs from a national security perspective and the inferences that might be drawn from this regarding work in the lawful interception area. CCD is a cross government programme led by the Home Office  however we may want to take advice from our partners before agreeing to any further release of costs information because of the national security dimension.
As exemptions for the GMPP are aligned to guidelines on FOI we don�t not think it appropriate to include information on CCD at the detail requested . Nor would it be appropriate to express the whole life costs of the programme in anything other than the economic costs already released to the public.","Cyclamen Programme claims exemption on national security and law enforcement grounds for the majority of sections of the GMPP Transparency Report.
� The Programme Name and Aims are in the public domain and not exempt
� All other requested information will be exempt under national security and law enforcement grounds
� Individual Project descriptions below headline programme aims will be exempt under national security and law enforcement grounds
As exemptions for the GMPP are aligned to guidelines on FOI we do not think it appropriate to include information on Cyclamen at the detail requested. Nor would it be appropriate to express the whole life costs of the programme in any documents that will be in the public domain.
The overall position on disclosure of information about Cyclamen has been cleared with Ministerial Special Advisors in the past, and there is a clear direction that it is in the public interest for published information to be restricted to the Programme Name and Aims only. The exemptions claimed here are in complete accordance with that prior direction, which was given on the basis that although there is a benefit to the security of the UK in criminal elements knowing that the capability exists to detect radiological materials on entry to the UK, there would be substantial disbenefit in providing any information that could potentially lead to any insight into the extent, coverage or effectiveness of this capability."
HO,Amber/Red,"The main IT supply contracts for the Home Office expire in 2016 (though there is a 12 month transition period built in to the contract which the programme is invoking). The main objective of the Programme is to replace the existing IT service provision for the core Home Office whilst:

� maximising the flexibility and agility of our IT provision
� minimising the impact of the change on the business
� innovating and making use of technology and process enhancements
